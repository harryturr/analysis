This is a quick and dirty plotting script for bias spectroscopy measurements
using GXSM, the open source scanning probe microscopy software.

First we need to convert the vpdata to a csv. You can use your preferred method, but 
I have included a python script I use for conversion. I like to automate batch process with bash.
